I am a Ph.D. student in [School of Electrical Engineering (EE), KAIST](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/), under the supervision of Prof. Jaekyun Moon (in [MoonLab](http://moonlab.kaist.ac.kr)\). Our laboratory has been studying in a wide range of research topics on hardware-friendly and robust machine learning algorithms. My own research emphasizes on developing **trustworthy AI systems** for safety-critical applications such as automotive, medical diagnosis, and manufactorying systems. In particular, I have explored the following areas:

1) **Post-Training for Large Models**: Test-Time Adaptation, Mask Tuning, Few-Shot Tuning, Transfer Learning<br> 
2) **Out-of-Domain (OOD) Robustness**: Domain Adaptation/Generalization<br>
3) **Trustworthy AI**: LLM Safety, Model Calibration, Adversarial Attack<br>
