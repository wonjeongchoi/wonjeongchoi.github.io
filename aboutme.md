### My story
I am a Ph.D. student in KAIST EE, under the supervision of Prof. Jaekyun Moon (in MoonLab). Our laboratory has been studying in a wide range of research topics on hardware-friendly and robust machine learning algorithms. My own research emphasizes on how to develop Trustworthy AI systems for safety-critical applications such as automotive, medical diagnosis, and manufactorying systems. Also, my recent interests involve Transfer Learning of large foundation models (e.g., LLMs, MLLMs) to specific domains, considering its robustness and resource-efficiency for low-data and hardware-complexity constrained applications.
